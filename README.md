# Hack Club Community

Simple [site](https://eankeen.github.io/hackclub-community) that showcases anything about the Hack Club Community!

This Aggregates cool stuff from the community and neatly categorizes them into sections where people can easily find them according to their interests (ex. minecraft, frontend web dev, etc.). The aim is to make it easy find stuff from all over the place (slack, HC website, HC github, events page, workshops) into a single place. So if you ask the question "What are the people in Hack Club doing?", you can find the answer here!
